### <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
The SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things Service enables customers and partners to develop, customize, and operate IoT business applications in the cloud. IoT Services provides Lifecycle management at scale for IoT devices from onboarding to decommissioning. It also provides a way to securely connect to remote devices over a broad variety of IoT protocols. It provides gateway Edge which provides one-premise IoT edge processing and also gateway cloud which does centralized cloud based processing.

The IoT cockpit is the user interface of the solution and provides access to various functions. It is the main interface for users to interact with the Internet of Things core service. It can be used creating user & tenants. Creating device data model, Device Onboarding and adding new networks etc. it can also be used to deploy interceptors, retrieve network logs, visualize the data which is being ingested via IoT devices/sensors.  
	![](images/000.png)

### <a name="device-onboarding"></a> Device onboarding
Each device exchanges data with a specific protocol (for example: REST in this exercise).  Each device corresponds to 1 unique physical node. We need to create physical node that corresponds to a physical device. In the following section, it is described how to create a Device for the REST network.

1.	On the IoT cockpit logon page, Open the **API Docs**  
	![](images/006.png)
1. Choose **Authorize**
	![](images/007.png)
1.	Enter the user **name** and **password** provided by the instructor and choose **Authorize** to logon
	![](images/008.png)
1. You should get an **Authorized** response. Close the the message from the top right corner  
	![](images/009.png)
1.	 Choose the **Capabilities** section and open the **POST** request to create a new capability. Then click on **Try it out**  
	![](images/010.png)
1.	Copy the following JSON script which defines a new capability named **Temperature** together with a new property and paste it in the **Example Value** text area. Then click **Execute**  

	```json
	{
	  "name": "Temperature",
	  "properties": [
	    {
	      "formatter": {
	        "swap": false,
	        "dataType": "float",
	        "shift": 0,
	        "scale": 0
	      },
		  "unitOfMeasure": "Â°C",
	      "dataType": "float",
	      "name": "Temperature"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	```
	![](images/011.png)

1.	You should get a response code of **200** and a response body like this. Copy and paste this response body in a text editor because you will need this information later in this section  
	![](images/012.png)

1.	Now you need to create a sensor type where the previously created Temperature capabilities is assigned to it. Go to the Home page of API services documentation and select **SensorTypes**  
	![](images/013.png)

1.	Choose the **POST** request and click on **Try it out**  
	![](images/014.png)

1.	Copy the following JSON script, which defines a new Sensor type with the name **gh\_climate\_sensor\_typ\_XX** (where **XX** must be replaced with your group number provided by the instructor). Replace **<<< Temperature Capability ID >>>** with the Temperature capability ID

 you have noted down in the previous steps. Once done paste the script in the **Example Value** text area and click **Execute**

 >NOTE: You must use **capabilities IDs** here because **AlternateIDs** are **NOT** used for creating sensor types

 ```json
 {
	  "protocol": "*",
	  "capabilities": [
	    {
	      "id": "<<< Temperature Capability ID >>>",
	      "type": "measure"
	    }
	  ],
	  "name": "gh_climate_sensor_typ_XX"
 }
 ```
 ![](images/015.png)

1. Log On to the **IoT Service Cockpit URL** with the credentials provided by the instructor  
	![](images/016.png)

### <a name="workflow"></a> SAP Cloud Platform Workflow
SAP Cloud Platform Workflow Service enables customers and partners to extend their core business process executed in S/4 HANA, Ariba, Concur, SuccessFactors, C4C and other 3rd Party applications. These extension applications enable customers to adopt changes in business very rapidly in an agile and non-disruptive way. Workflow Service enables business users to use SAP My Inbox, a FIORI based application to manage their tasks.  It offers out of the box FIORI based monitoring applications to keep track of the deployed workflows and workflow instances operated in the system.
Workflow Service offers BPMN 2.0 based Business Process Modeling tools in SAP Web IDE and enables customers/partners to quickly build and deploy workflows. It exposes REST APIs to Read/Create/Modify/Cancel workflow instances and task instances from the system.

#### --- Preparing SAP Web IDE Full-Stack ---
In this exercise, you will manage your workflow using SAP Web IDE Full-Stack.

1. Open the configuration URL document. Documents are available inside *Iflowgenerator* folder. Please use the file (*URLS\_rktw002.TXT* or *URLS\_rktw003.TXT*) assigned to you by the instructor

1. Copy the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack EU Data Center URL and paste it in a new Chrome browser window  
	![](images/063.png)

1. You SAP Web IDE Full-Stack opens up  
	![](images/064.png)

1. Click on the **small gear** on the left toolbar, select **Features**, enter "**workflow**" in the search box, the **Workflow Editor** plugin is listed. Set it to **ON** (if not set already) and click **Save**. You will be requested to refresh your SAP Web IDE: click on **Refresh**  
	![](images/065.png)
	![](images/066.png)

#### --- Deleting an existing project ---
If you find content from previous runs of the CPL265 session in the workspace, remove the content as follows:

1. On the left toolbar, click on the Development tab **</>**. Check your workspace: if you see that a project with the name *CPL265-ParticipantXX*, where **XX** is your workstation ID, already exists, please follow the next step to delete it, otherwise you can simply skip the next step  
	![](images/067.png)

1. Right click on the name of the project that you want to delete and from the context menu choose **Delete**. Click **OK** to confirm the operation and the project will be removed from the workspace  
	![](images/068.png)

#### --- Creating a workflow project with SAP Web IDE Full-Stack ---
With the help of the IoT-enabled sensors, it is possible to monitor the health of associated devices, such as coolers. With the help of Business Rules, temperature data can be filtered to situations that are considered critical for the device, for example, when the device is unable to sufficiently cool the contents inside of it.

In such a situation, it might be advisable to request a service technician to check the device on site. As this is a costly operation, the respective request might require further remote investigations, detailed data analysis or approval. To coordinate these actions or route them to the right people for these tasks, we model a Service Request workflow.

1. Click on **File -> New -> Project from Template**  
	![](images/069.png)

1. Select the Category **Business Process Management**: a **Workflow Project** template tile appears, select it and click **Next**  
	![](images/070.png)

1. Enter the project name *CPL265-ParticipantXX*, where **XX** is your workstation ID, and click **Next**  
	![](images/071.png)

1. Enter *ServiceRequestParticipantXX* as the Workflow Project name, where **XX** is your workstation ID, and click **Finish**  
	![](images/072.png)

1. A new worflow is created  
	![](images/073.png)

#### --- Model Workflow Properties and Steps ---
The workflow modeled in this exercise is condensed to a user task that shows relevant information in the "My Inbox" application. Here a user, such as a person in the role of a data analyst or service request coordinator, can decide on whether to send the technician on site.

The workflow could be extended in the following ways, which are supported by Cloud Platform Workflow functionality:

-	The task user interface could be enhanced to link to suitable data analysis tools or display relevant diagrams directly.
-	Depending on the approval of the coordinator, the service request could be entered into a Service Management system, for example by calling its REST APIs through the "Service Task" step type. For interactions requiring other protocols (e. g. SOAP), Service Tasks could be used to interact with Cloud Platform Integration to route the calls further.
-	When creating a service request, the workflow could be enhanced to wait for an asynchronous confirmation from the Service Management system, with the help of "Intermediate Message Events". The confirmation might contain the date and time, when the technician is expected to arrive and fix the device. The information could be forwarded to the service request coordinator.

>NOTE: colors and other visual appearance might differ slightly from the following screens, as the workflow editor might have received feature upgrades since production of this content

1. In the **Workflow Properties** pane on the right, enter this text as the **Subject**

	```
	${context.Device} (${context.DeviceId}): Confirm Service Request
	```

	![](images/074.png)

1. Click on the **Tasks** icon on the left side of the workflow editor and select **User Task**. A new task is created: drag & drop it just on top of the connection line between the start and the end events  
	![](images/075.png)

### <a name="br"></a> SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules
SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules is a technology service that translates business decision logic into a natural language that is configurable directly by line of business key users, knowledge experts without IT or developer intervention. It provides solution architects and developers web based tools to model, author and simulate business rules independent of the backend system.

Please use for login the user given by your instructor.

#### --- Edit Threshold Exceeds Rule ---
SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules allows end users to model and arrange rules in the form of projects. To model a typical executable rule service the required vocabulary needs to be created in the form of data objects. The actual business logic is modelled in a set of rules and these are associated with the rule service using the rule set as logical containers.
To simplify the number of steps involved in modelling & deploying the rule service we already created a separate project for each participant with a decision table having all the necessary conditions and results.
Your goal here is to create a rule in the decision table to determine whether the measurement values are exceeding a threshold value. The final rule service is then deployed to make it available for the integration flow which is responsible to decide whether the Service Request workflow needs to be triggered.

1. Open the configuration URL document. Documents are available inside Iflowgenerator folder. Please use the file (URLS\_rktw002.TXT or URLS\_rktw003.TXT) assigned to you by the instructor, with the same steps you have done at the beginning of the previous chapter and locate the Business Rules Service Tenant URL. Copy this URL and paste it in a new browser window  
	![](images/081.png)

1.  Click on the project **CPL265ParticipantXX** where **XX** is your associated workstation ID  
	![](images/082.png)

1. Be sure you have selected the right project and select the **Rules** tab. Then click on the **ThresholdExceedsRule** item  
	![](images/083.png)

1. Once inside the project, click on **Edit**  
	![](images/084.png)

1. Click on **Add Row -> Insert First** in the **Decision Table** tab   
	![](images/085.png)

1. Specify the new rule with the following parameters:

	|Parameter|Value|
	|---------|-----|
	|Name of the Measurement|is equal to 'temperature'|
	|Value of the Measurement|is greater than 40|
	|ThesholdExceeds|true|

	then click on **Activate**
	![](images/086.png)

1. After a while you should receive a message that the rule has been successfully activated and the rule status changes to **Active**  
	![](images/087.png)


#### --- Deploy ThresholdExceeds Rule Service ---

1. Click on **CPL265ParticipantXX**, where **XX** represents your workstation ID, to go back to your rule project  
	![](images/088.png)

1. Select the **Rule Services** tab and click on **Deploy**  
	![](images/089.png)

1. Select **CLOUD** as the system where to deploy  
	![](images/090.png)

1. The rule service is deployed successfully
