1. [Setup the Development Environment](#setup-dev-env)
1. [Use SAP Leonardo ML Image Classification with SAPUI5](#image-classification)
1. [Adjust the prepared SAPUI5 application to access your ML foundation services](#adjust-app)


### <a name="setup-dev-env"></a> Setup the Development Environment
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 applications, we will work with SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services.
In this chapter, you will initialize the SAP Web IDE and import the given project. It will be used later in the corresponding exercises.

Required resources for this step:

* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Exercise.zip?raw=true)
* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Solution.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Solution.zip?raw=true) (only required if you get stuck with the exercise and you want to go straight to the solution)

	![](images/10.png)

	We will need this project later in the next exercises when you develop SAPUI5 apps to call ML Foundation services

1.	You should see a files and folder structure similar to the one shown on this screenshot

	![](images/11.png)

1. You have successfully imported the exercise project in SAP Web IDE.


### <a name="image-classification"></a> Use SAP Leonardo ML Image Classification with SAPUI5
In this exercise you will learn how to quickly integrate in a SAPUI5 application the Image Classification provided by the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Functional Services and published in the SAP API Business Hub sandbox. These will be the steps you will go through:

* Check that the **webide_di** destination exists
* Create a new destination to the ML service sandbox endpoint in API Business Hub
* Use the API Key for the image and product image classification from SAP API Business Hub
* Adjust your prepared SAPUI5 application
* Run the SAPUI5 application and test your ML Services

1.	Go back to the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit and select your trial account from the top menu then on the left side bar, select **Connectivity -> Destinations**. Check whether the **webide_di** destination exists. If not you need to install it. If this destination already exists please skip to step 8  
	>NOTE: This destination is only required by SAP Web IDE to run applications in Web Preview mode: it's not related to ML

	![](images/14.png)

1. Download the destination from by right clicking [here](files/webide_di.txt?raw=true) and choosing save to disk

1. Once the destination has been downloaded, click on **Import Destination**, browse for the file you have just downloaded and import it  
	![](images/15.png)

1. Replace the account in the destination URL with your account  
	![](images/16.png)

1. Save the destination  
	![](images/17.png)

1. Click on **Check Connection** to test if the **webide_di** destination is working fine
	![](images/18.png)

1. You should receive a status code of **200**   
	![](images/19.png)

1. Click on **New Destination**  
	![](images/20.png)

1. Enter the following information and click on the **New Property** button   

	|Parameter|Value|
	|---------|-----|
	|Name|sapui5ml-api|
	|Type|HTTP|
	|Description|SAP Leonardo Machine Learning APIs|
	|URL|https://sandbox.api.sap.com/mlfs/api/v2|
	|Proxy Type|Internet|
	|Authentication|NoAuthentication|

	![](images/21.png)

1. Add the property **WebIDEEnabled = true** to the destination and click **Save**
	![](images/22.png)

1.	You can use the **Check Connection** button to validate that the URL can be accessed
	![](images/23.png)

1. The response should be `Connection to "sapui5ml-api" established. Response returned: "404: Not Found"`  
	![](images/24.png)


### <a name="adjust-app"></a> Adjust the prepared SAPUI5 application to access your ML foundation services
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 and Java applications, we will work with the SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services.

1.	Go to your SAP Web IDE Full-Stack edition and open the file  *MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise/neo-app.json*  
	![](images/25.png)

1. Add a new route to the new destination named **sapui5ml-api**, we previously created in the SAP CP cockpit. You can copy the following code into the file (pay attention to the first comma which separates this from the previous resources)

	```json
	,
	    {
	    	"path": "/ml",
	    	"target": {
	    		"type": "destination",
	    		"name": "sapui5ml-api"
	    	},
	    	"description": "ML API description"
	    }
	```
	![](images/26.png)

1. Scroll to the end of the *neo-app.json* file and add the String **"APIKey",** (pay attention to include the comma) to the **headerWhiteList** section and then **save** the file. This is how the file should look after these operations  
	![](images/27.png)

1. Open the file *MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise/webapp/model/settings.json*
	![](images/28.png)

1. Before we proceed with editing the *settings.json*, we need to get the **API Key** for the ML services from the API Business Hub - as done in the preceding exercise

1. Go to <https://api.sap.com>

1. Click on the **Log On** button on the top right corner and login with your trial account credentials  
	![](images/30.png)

1.	Once logged in, click on the drop down list in the top right corner of the screen and choose **Preferences**  
	![](images/31.png)

1.	Click on **Show API Key**  
	![](images/32.png)

1. Click on **Copy Key and Close**: the API key gets copied in your clipboard  
	![](images/33.png)

1. Now go back to your SAP Web IDE in SAP Cloud Platform, where the *settings.json* is still open.
Replace the **<<<< COPY YOUR API KEY >>>>** string with the API key you copied in the clipboard and **Save** the file
	![](images/34.png)

1.	Click on the **Run** icon on the toolbar to execute the application - you will probably need to *allow pop-ups* then click on **Run** again
	![](images/35.png)

1. The application comes up. Extract the 4 images contained in the zip file ([test_images.zip](files/test_images.zip?raw=true)) you have already downloaded during the previous exercise  

1. Click on the blue icon containing a camera and select the *tennis_ball.jpg* image from the dialog

	![](images/37.png)

1. The application displays the 5 most probable classifications for the image. To see the actual response from the server you can press the "View JSON" Button
	![](images/38.png)

1. Do the same for the other images by pressing the icon to open a file select dialog. Analyze the results - they should be the same as in the previous exercise

1. This concludes the exercise


## Summary
This concludes the exercise. You are now able to:

* Import a project into SAP Web IDE Full-Stack
* Setup the development environment
* Use SAP Leonardo ML Image Classification with SAPUI5

 Please proceed with the next exercise.
